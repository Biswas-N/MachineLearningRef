# Decision Tree regression
 This algorithm is of both Regression and Classification, But we will be talking about Regression. It can predict Dependent variables based on given Independent variables.
	
	## Explanation:
	Theoretically the Independent variables  is done by splitting the Scatter Plots of the Independent variables (X1 and X2 in this case). The value of Y is the average value of Y corresponding to X1 and X2 in the respective splits

Later these scatter plot splits are constructed into descison trees.
