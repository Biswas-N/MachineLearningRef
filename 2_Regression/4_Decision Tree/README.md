# Decision Tree regression
 This algorithm is of both Regression and Classification, But we will be talking about Regression. It can predict Dependent variables based on given Independent variables.
	
## Explanation:
Theoretically the prediction is done by splitting the Scatter Plots of the Independent variables (X1 and X2) and computing the value of Y by averaging all the values of Y corresponding to X1 and X2 in their split regions (As Shown below)

Later these scatter plot splits are constructed into decision trees.
